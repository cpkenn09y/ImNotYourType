## My role within the project:
* On this project, all four of us spiked to develop the game's logic.
* By day 1, Natalie and I developed a basic type racer
* We had just learned about event listeners. By using the keypress event, we analyzed each typed letter and compared it to the string prompt that users were attempting to type.
* I paired with Natalie to write WPM calculator and timer. We also developed the animations of the girl running.
* Created with 2 weeks of Javascript knowledge, within a week.

## Release 1, MVP
* User can view home page
* User can enter text into a text area
* User can continue typing text until the game is finished

  * Seconds Elapsed
  * WPM
