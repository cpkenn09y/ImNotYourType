Code with Nyan
==============

## Mission Statement:
* Code with Nyan is a web app where kids discover the wonders of programming through a friendly drawing interface. Kids use creativity and problem solving skills to explore different ways to draw. All the while, children learn valuable programming concepts such as: pattern recognition, method chaining, and looping. Go forth and code!

Team Members
------------
* Kenneth Yu [@cpkenn09y](https://github.com/cpkenn09y)
* Jenny Yee [@jenwen](https://github.com/jewnwen)
* Robert Taraya [@roberttaraya](https://github.com/roberttaraya)

## My Role in the Project:

### (As a Team):
* Created the idea
* Chose core functionalities of the language
* Chose the language to be expressive and intuitive
* Discussed all the design elements of the project, such as: language design, teaching principles, instant feedback, user interface, and user experience.

### (Pair with Robert):
* Developed the language parser
  * [parser.js](https://github.com/cpkenn09y/CodeWithNyan/blob/master/javascripts/parser.js) <- Link to Code
* Enabled basic movement, such as: forward 5, backward 10, etc.
* Enabled rotations of any degree amount, such as: rotate 720, rotate 265
* Further developed language parser to allow for method chaining, such as: 'forward 7, rotate 30'
* Tuned the language parser to allow for looping of chained methods, such as: '(backward 13, rotate 55) repeat 10'
* Developed the visual representations of the sprite movements
  * [sprite.js](https://github.com/cpkenn09y/CodeWithNyan/blob/master/javascripts/sprite.js) <- Link to Code
  * [path.js](https://github.com/cpkenn09y/CodeWithNyan/blob/master/javascripts/path.js) <- Link to Code

###(Pair with Jenny)
* Made the canvases dynamically resize based on window size
  * [resize_controller.js](https://github.com/cpkenn09y/CodeWithNyan/blob/master/javascripts/resize_controller.js) <- Link to Code
* Improved overall user experience and user interface

###(Solo)
* Allow saving of images by using the Imgur API
  * [imageuploader.js](https://github.com/cpkenn09y/CodeWithNyan/blob/master/javascripts/imageuploader.js) <- Link to Code
* Wrote all of our Jasmine Tests; to ensure that Language Parser remains intact
  * [parser_spec.js](https://github.com/cpkenn09y/CodeWithNyan/blob/master/spec/javascripts/parser_spec.js) <- Link to Code
* Created a textbox that dynamically resizes based on the amount of text within the field
* Developed feature that allows users to access past commands by using the up or down arrow
* Enabled customization of colors and line widths
* Enable users to clear command log from the textbox
* Enable users to reset the canvas

### Note:
* This project was created in one week
* Many commits were made by us under the default DBC git config of ‘Apprentice’
* This is our updated intepretation of the classic children's game, based on the Turtle Logo Programming Language.
